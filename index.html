      <h2>Workshop Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Physical interaction is one of the most dependable and common methods
        for understanding the physical properties of soft objects. In the
        medical domain and Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS), the fundamental
        diagnosis technique known as palpation was a staple in first-line
        examinations to identify stiff tissues and hard masses. Branching
        further into the agricultural field, assessing the stiffness of fruits
        allows farmers and machines to determine the quality of the produce and
        their readiness for consumption.

        Today, with rapid advancements in soft robotics, soft haptics for
        teleoperation, agrifood systems, and industrial automation, there is
        growing interest in replicating this human ability to sense stiffness in
        robots. The stiffness perception of soft matter is essential for
        developing robotic systems that can interact safely, adaptively, and
        intelligently with soft objects in their environment.

        This workshop aims to unite researchers and practitioners from multiple
        disciplines to share insights on sensing the stiffness of soft matter
        and its significance in enabling safer robotic interactions. It also
        aims to explore a psychophysical perspective for improving soft matter
        perception in robots.

        Through talks, discussions, and collaborative sessions, participants
        will explore the current state of stiffness sensing technologies, their
        practical applications, and the challenges that remain in understanding
        and modelling tactile perception.

        <br /><br />
        <b>Objectives:</b><br />
        • Distinguish between tactile sensing and stiffness sensing and
        understand how these concepts are interrelated. <br />
        • Explain how tactile sensing mechanisms can be applied to measure
        stiffness across different materials and environments.<br />
        • Understand how humans perceive stiffness through touch, and how these
        mechanical, psychological, and neurological mechanisms can inspire the
        design of robotic stiffness sensors.<br />
        • Examine diverse applications of stiffness sensing, including its use
        in medicine, agriculture, material identification, robotic
        manipulation, etc.<br />
        • Discuss the role of stiffness perception in enhancing human and robot
        performance in teleoperation, virtual training, simulation systems,
        etc.<br />
        • Integrate interdisciplinary perspectives to propose future directions
        for research in robotic perception and human-machine interaction.<br />
